Thinking about the program you worked on today:

How similar was your plan to the final program? Did you have to digress from your plan as the program developed?

Does each of your classes follow the Single Responsibility principle? Or are any of your classes doing too much?
Yes we split the code so that the classes have single responsibility.

Did you practice TDD?
Yes we followed TDD throughout the task and it helped us to fix the issues as we were adding new features in the code.

Are each of your methods tested? Did you find anything difficult to test?
Yes we wrote tests for all the methods.
